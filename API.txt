CURRENT API VERSION: 2.0
------------------------
This file contains a list of API revisions and the breaking changes that may
affect developers of modules integrating with Address Field Lookup.

API VERSION 2.0
---------------
* Refactored setLookupTerm(), lookup() and getLookupResult() functions into a
  single function - lookup($term). This function now accepts the search term
  as a required paramater and returns either the array of search results or
  FALSE if no results could be found.

* All integrating modules must define a 'object factory' key in their
  implementation of hook_addressfield_lookup_service_info. This key refers to
  a function responsible for instantiating the PHP class that implements the
  AddressFieldLookupInterface interface. The function receives the service info
  array as a parameter.
